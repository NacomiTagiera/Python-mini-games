### Game Rules

- The game is played with two paddles and a ball.
- Player A moves their paddle up with the 'w' key and down with the 's' key.
- Player B uses the 'Up' arrow key and the 'Down' arrow key to move their paddle up and down.
- The ball moves around the screen. When it hits a player's paddle, it bounces back.
- If the ball hits the left or right edge of the screen, the other player scores a point.
- The game will continue to run until you manually close it.

### How to Play

2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Run `python pong.py` in your terminal to start the game.
4. Try to hit the ball with your paddle to prevent the other player from scoring points.
