# Pong

It is my first mini-game written in Python. I created it using Python's *turtle* library. The library allows users to create shapes, drawings, and animations in a simple and intuitive way by providing a set of methods and functions that can be used to control a turtle object on the screen.

The game I created is **Pong** - a classic arcade video game that was released in 1972. It's a two-player game where each player controls a paddle on their side of the screen. The goal is to hit a ball back and forth between the two players using the paddle. If the other player misses the ball, points are earned.
