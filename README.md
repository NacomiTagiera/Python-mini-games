# Snake Game

Snake is a video game genre where the player maneuvers a snake, that grows bigger after eating apples, making the snake a primary obstacle to itself. This is my first-ever implementation of Snake. I created it to practice Python and *pygame* library. In the future, I want to build a better-looking version of this project.
