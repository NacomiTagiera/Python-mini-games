# Pong

I am excited to share my first mini-game written in Python, which I created using the Turtle library. Turtle is a built-in library in Python that makes it easy to create graphics, animations, and even interactive games and simulations. It is beginner-friendly and often used as a starting point for learning programming and computer graphics.

The game I created is the classic arcade video game Pong, which was first released in 1972. It's a two-player game where each player controls a paddle on their side of the screen. The objective is to hit a ball back and forth between the two players using the paddle. Points are earned when the other player misses the ball.
