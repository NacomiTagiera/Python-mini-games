# Pong

It is my first mini game written in Python. I created it using Python's *turtle* library. The library allows users to create shapes, drawings, and animations in a simple and intuitive way by providing a set of methods and functions that can be used to control a turtle object on the screen.

**Pong** is a classic arcade video game that was first released in 1972. It is a two-player game where each player controls a paddle on their side of the screen, and the goal is to use the paddle to hit a ball back and forth between the two players. The players score points when the other player fails to hit the ball.
