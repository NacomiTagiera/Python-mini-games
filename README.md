# Snake Game

Snake is a video game genre where the player maneuvers a snake, that grows bigger after eating apples, making the snake a primary obstacle to itself. I created it to practice Python and *pygame* library. Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for creating games and multimedia applications. It includes functionality to handle graphics, sound, input, and other features commonly used in game development.
